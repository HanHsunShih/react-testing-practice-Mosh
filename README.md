# React Testing Practice

This project is built based on the [Mosh Hamedani React Testing Tutorial](https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/react-testing-starter).

I followed along and rewrote the code to reinforce my understanding of React testing.  
All commits and notes are part of my learning process.

## What I Learned
- Setting up testing environment
- Writing unit and integration tests with Testing Library
- Mocking API calls and simulating user interaction
